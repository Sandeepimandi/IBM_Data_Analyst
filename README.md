# IBM Capstone Project

Welcome to my **IBM Capstone Project**! In this project, I take on the role of a Data Analyst for a leading global IT and business consulting firm. This organization is widely recognized for its expertise in IT solutions and its talented professionals. To maintain a competitive edge and stay ahead of rapidly advancing technologies, the company conducts regular analyses to forecast future skill demands. 

As a Data Analyst, my task is to gather and analyze data from various sources to detect emerging trends in programming skills. This information will be crucial for the company's annual report on evolving skill sets.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into multiple phases, each of which is documented in individual Jupyter notebooks.

### Week 1: Data Collection
The first step is collecting data on the most in-demand programming skills. I will gather information from a variety of sources including:
- Job postings
- Online training platforms
- Industry surveys and polls

I will employ web scraping, APIs, and other tools to retrieve data in different formats such as CSV files, Excel sheets, and databases.

### Week 2: Data Wrangling
Next, I will clean and prepare the raw data for analysis using data wrangling techniques. This ensures the data is consistent, well-structured, and ready for deeper analysis.

### Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Once the data is clean, I will conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships. Statistical methods will be applied to gain preliminary insights into the data.

### Week 4: Data Visualization
To make the findings more digestible, I will create visual representations of the data. These will include charts, graphs, and other forms of visualization to highlight key trends.

### Week 5: Building a Dashboard
Using **IBM Cognos Analytics**, I will develop an interactive dashboard that consolidates all the analyzed data. The dashboard will help answer questions such as:
- Which programming languages are in highest demand?
- What database skills are most sought-after?
- Which Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are the most popular?

### Week 6: Presentation of Findings
Finally, I will present my findings using data storytelling techniques. The presentation will summarize the trends and insights gathered throughout the project, providing actionable recommendations for the organization.
